# Functions

In this lesson I learned:

 - Rust convention is to use *snake case* for functions names;
 - Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller;
 - in function signatures, you *must* declare the type of each parameter;
 - the difference between statements and expressions in Rust. *Statements* are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. *Expressions* evaluate to a resulting value. Let’s look at some examples;
 - variable defenition is an expression;
 - expressions do not include ending semicolons;
 - the return value of the function is the final expression. You can return early by using keyword `return`;
