# Concise Control Flow with *if let*

In this lesson I learned:
  - `if let` as syntax sugar for a `match` that runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values;
  - the syntax `if let` takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal sign;
  - the block of code that goes with the `else` is the same as the block of code that would go with the `_` case in the match expression.
